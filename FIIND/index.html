        <p> Project FIIND is an international effort to create the most detailed description of the
    development of the ferret brain. The first days after birth in ferrets provide a
    unique view of the development of a complex brain. Unlike mice, ferrets
    develop a rich pattern of deep neocortical folds and cortico-cortical connections. Unlike
    humans and other primates, whose brains are well differentiated and folded at birth,
    ferrets are born with a very immature and completely smooth neocortex: folds, neocortical
    regionalisation and cortico-cortical connectivity develop in ferrets during the first
    days after birth. After a period of fast neocortical expansion, during which brain volume
    increases by up to a factor of 4 in 2 weeks, the ferret brain reaches its adult volume at
    about 6 weeks of age.</p>

        <br/>
        <strong> The ferret: an exceptional animal model for neuroimaging</strong>
        <p> Ferrets appear as an exceptional animal model to investigate the neurobiological
    correlates of the phenomena observed in human neuroimaging. Many of these phenomena, such
    as the relationship between brain folding, cortico-cortical connectivity and neocortical
    regionalisation cannot be investigated in mice, but could be investigated in ferrets.</p>

        <strong> An open science project</strong>
        <p> We are constituting an open, collaborative atlas of ferret brain development,
    integrating multi-modal and multi-scale data. We are acquiring data from many animals,
    from newborns to adults, using high-resolution MRI, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and
    high-throughput histology. Brains will be sectioned at 25 μm and scanned at 0.25 μm of
    resolution, and processed for real-time multi-scale
    visualisation. We are building a web-platform to integrate an interactive
    multi-scale visualisation of the data. Using our combined expertise in computational
    neuroanatomy, multi-modal neuroimaging, neuroinformatics, and the development of
    inter-species atlases, we are building an open-source web platform to allow the
    collaborative, online, creation of atlases of the development of the ferret brain. The web
    platform will allow researchers to access and visualise interactively the MRI and
    histology data. It will also allow researchers to create collaborative, human curated, 3D
    segmentations of brain structures, as well as vectorial atlases. Our work should provide a
    first integrated atlas of ferret brain development, and the basis for an open platform for
    the creation of collaborative multi-modal, multi-scale, multi-species atlases.</p>
